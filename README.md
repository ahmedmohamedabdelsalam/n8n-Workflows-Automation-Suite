# N8N Workflow Powerhouse: AI, Automation & Agentic Examples

Welcome to the N8N Workflow Powerhouse! This repository is a public collection of diverse and powerful n8n workflows designed to showcase a wide range of automation possibilities, with a strong focus on AI-driven tasks, agentic systems, and practical integrations.

Whether you're new to n8n, an experienced automator, or an AI enthusiast, you'll find valuable examples, templates, and inspiration here. Our goal is to help you learn, build, and supercharge your own n8n projects.

## What's Inside

This repository contains:

1. **A Collection of `.json` Workflow Files:**
    * Dozens of ready-to-import n8n workflows covering use cases like:
        * Advanced AI Document Parsing (Invoices, LlamaParse)
        * AI Agent Chatbots with long-term memory and tool usage (OpenAI, Ollama, Google Gemini)
        * YouTube Content Summarization, Transcription & Analysis
        * Automated Social Media Content Creation & Publishing
        * RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Chatbots
        * Blog Content Automation from PDFs
        * Local AI Assistants with Ollama
        * Web Scraping & Data Aggregation
        * Database Interaction & Chart Generation
        * Utilities like Workflow Backups, RSS Feed Monitoring

2. **Aggregated Workflow JSON (`workflows-aggregated.md`):**
    * Contains raw JSON of all workflows for reference, learning, or LLM analysis.

3. **Workflow Titles and Descriptions (`workflow-descriptions.md`):**
    * Human-readable table with workflow titles and brief descriptions for easy discovery and context.

## Why This Repository

* Learn n8n best practices and workflow structuring.
* Grab ready-to-use templates to kickstart projects.
* Explore advanced AI and agentic systems, RAG implementations, and multi-tool usage.
* Understand integrations with services like Google Drive, Gmail, Telegram, WordPress, OpenAI, Ollama.
* Explore local LLM workflows with private AI setups.

## Using These Workflows

### Import `.json` Workflow Files into n8n

1. Open a workflow `.json` file in a text editor or GitHub.
2. Copy the entire JSON content.
3. Open your n8n instance and go to the workflow canvas.
4. Paste the JSON content; the workflow will appear on your canvas.

### Configuration Notes

* Replace placeholders for API keys, URLs, chat IDs, Google Doc/Sheet IDs, etc., with your own valid values.
* Nodes that interact with external services require proper credentials in n8n.
* Test each workflow thoroughly before using in production.

## Prerequisites

* n8n instance (self-hosted or cloud)
* API credentials for OpenAI, Google Cloud, Telegram, WordPress, Ollama, etc.
* Install any required community nodes for full functionality.
* Basic understanding of the services being automated is helpful.

## Highlights

* Advanced Document Processing with AI-driven structuring
* Sophisticated AI Agents with multi-tool and long-term memory
* Automated Content Creation & Publishing pipelines
* Private AI implementations using Ollama and local LLMs

## Disclaimer

* Workflows are provided as-is for educational purposes.
* Use responsibly and test thoroughly in safe environments.
* Consider API usage costs and terms of service for external services.
